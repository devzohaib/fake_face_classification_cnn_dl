# Fake Face Detection by Deep Learning Technique

With the growing era of social media, it is difficult to identify the real from fake whether it is any news or face/video of any celebrity, politician etc. Also, the fake or manipulated faces and videos are being generated enormously which are harder to detect by traditional means of software or methods. Therefore, Deep Learning which is a subset of Machine Learning can be employed to identify the real or fake images/faces/videos efficiently

### Tools:
- Python (programming language)
- Keras (API)
- Tensorflow (open source software library for machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook (open source web application)
- Matplotlib (library)
- Numpy (library for the python)
